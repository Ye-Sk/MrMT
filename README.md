# Related Work
To the best of our knowledge, existing datasets maize tassels are too scarce to support further research. Based on the MrMT dataset we trained and evaluated [**TasselLFANet (Lightweight Multi-Branch Feature Aggregation Neural Network)**](https://github.com/Ye-Sk/LFANet), was evaluated with good results. At the same time, we made the datasets and corresponding annotations publicly available in order to provide more convenience for researchers, and allow researchers to conduct more agricultural research, such as crop growth stage detection that requires more detailed data.

# Introduction
We constructed the MrMT（Multi-regional Maize Tassels）dataset from the tasselling stage to the flowering stage through 12 independent time image sequences. This dataset contains a total of 1968 field images and 96434 corresponding annotations, is a large-scale, high-cost dataset. Importantly, the MrMT dataset is abundant for maize tassels imaging at different times, which provides more selectivity for subsequent studies. In the end, we hope that our work will help pave the way for future work at the intersection of machine learning and agriculture, ultimately benefiting plant science.
